## Post-Deployment Verification (To Run)

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl -s https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/health | jq
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "ok",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "service": "wegmans-shopping"
}
```

### 2. Search Functionality
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"search_term": "bananas", "max_results": 3}' | jq
```

**Expected:**
- Returns 3 products
- Each has: name, price, aisle, image
- Response time: ~1 second

### 3. Batch Image API
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/images/fetch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_names": ["Bananas", "Milk"]}' | jq
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "success_count": 2,
  "total_count": 2
}
```

### 4. Rate Limiting
```bash
for i in {1..65}; do
  curl -s -w "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null \
    -X POST https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/search \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"search_term\": \"test$i\", \"max_results\": 1}"
done | grep -c "429"
```

**Expected:**
- First 60 requests: 200 OK
- Requests 61+: 429 Too Many Requests

### 5. Connection Pooling (Check Logs)

**Expected in Render logs:**
```
INFO:src.database:✓ Database connection pool created (2-10 connections)
```

### 6. Cart Operations
```bash
# Add to cart
curl -s -X POST https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/cart/add \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Product", "price": "$5.99", "quantity": 1}' | jq

# Get cart
curl -s https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/cart | jq
```

**Expected:**
- Add succeeds with `"success": true`
- Get returns cart with items

### 7. Frequent Items
```bash
curl -s https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/frequent | jq
```

**Expected:**
- Returns list of frequent items (or empty array)

---

## Performance Verification

### Response Time Benchmarks

**Health Check:**
```bash
time curl -s https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/health > /dev/null
```
**Expected:** < 500ms

**Search (first time - Algolia API):**
```bash
time curl -s -X POST https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"search_term": "uniquesearch123", "max_results": 5}' > /dev/null
```
**Expected:** ~1-2 seconds (Algolia API call)

**Search (cached):**
```bash
time curl -s -X POST https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"search_term": "bananas", "max_results": 5}' > /dev/null
```
**Expected:** < 500ms (from cache)

**Batch Images:**
```bash
time curl -s -X POST https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/images/fetch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_names": ["Bananas", "Milk", "Bread"]}' > /dev/null
```
**Expected:** ~2-3 seconds (3 products)

## Monitoring Checks

### 1. Check Render Logs

Look for:
- ✅ `✓ Database connection pool created (2-10 connections)`
- ✅ `🚀 Starting Wegmans Shopping App`
- ✅ No error messages
- ✅ Request logs showing 200 responses
- ✅ Rate limit 429 responses after 60 requests

### 2. Database Connection Pool

**Check logs for:**
- Pool creation message on startup
- No "too many connections" errors
- Stable connection count

### 3. Memory Usage

**Monitor over 24 hours:**
- Should remain stable (no growth)
- Token cleanup logs every 5 minutes (if users are active)

### 4. Error Rate

**Expected:**
- 200 OK: >95% of requests
- 400/422: <3% (validation errors)
- 429: <2% (rate limiting)
- 500: <0.1% (server errors)

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues found:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert 7e3602a

# Or reset to previous version
git reset --hard 0fb6ebe

# Push
git push origin main --force
```

**Render will auto-deploy the rollback within ~2-3 minutes**

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Critical) ✅
- [x] Application starts without errors
- [x] Health check returns 200 OK
- [x] Search returns products
- [x] Database connected
- [x] No 500 errors under normal load

### Should Have (Important) ⏳
- [ ] Response times < 2 seconds
- [ ] Rate limiting enforced (429 after 60/min)
- [ ] Connection pool active (in logs)
- [ ] Batch image API working
- [ ] No memory growth over 24 hours

### Nice to Have (Optional) ⏳
- [ ] Search cache hit rate > 30%
- [ ] Anonymous user cleanup scheduled
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable
- [ ] Deployment size reduced (visible in Render dashboard)

---

## Known Issues / Expected Behavior

### Database Schema
- `public.users` has 6 columns (clean) ✅
- `auth.users` has 35 columns (Supabase's, separate schema) ✅
- When querying without schema, both appear (41 total) - This is normal!

### Rate Limiting
- Tests run with `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=false` (for isolation) ✅
- Production runs with `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true` (default) ✅
- Limit: 60 requests/minute per IP ✅

### Test Coverage
- 61% coverage is good for initial test suite
- Auth endpoints: 49% (complex, needs more tests)
- Lists endpoints: 35% (complex, needs more tests)
- Core functionality: 70-90% (well tested)

---

## Monitoring Commands

**Check production health:**
```bash
curl https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/health
```

**Test search:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"search_term": "bananas", "max_results": 5}'
```

**Test rate limiting:**
```bash
for i in {1..65}; do
  curl -s -w "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null \
    -X POST https://wegmans-shopping.onrender.com/api/search \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"search_term\": \"rate$i\", \"max_results\": 1}"
done
```

**Check anonymous users (via local script):**
```bash
python scripts/cleanup_anonymous_users.py --stats
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

**Immediate (Today):**
- [ ] Verify health check passes
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test batch image API
- [ ] Check Render logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor response times

**Within 24 Hours:**

- [ ] Check error logs (should be minimal)
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works
- [ ] Test from mobile device
- [ ] Check frequent items loading speed

**Within 1 Week:**
- [ ] Set up cron job for anonymous user cleanup
- [ ] Monitor performance improvements
- [ ] Review Render metrics (response times, memory)
- [ ] Gather user feedback (if any)
